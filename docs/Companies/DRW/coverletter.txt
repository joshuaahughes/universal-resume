Dear DRW Hiring Manager,

When I learned about the Executive Support Engineer position at DRW, I was immediately drawn to your firm's commitment to bringing sophisticated technology and exceptional people together. As someone who's spent three years providing technical support across diverse environments while maintaining the highest service standards, I'm excited about the opportunity to deliver world-class executive experiences for your C-Suite staff and administrative teams.

In my current role at Information Technology Solutions, I've developed extensive experience supporting executives and their administrative staff across the exact technical landscape you require. I regularly troubleshoot macOS, Windows, and iOS systems while configuring AV conferencing equipment for both office and residential locations. My work supporting remote physicians required implementing prosumer technology solutions including custom networking setups, desktop configurations, and seamless A/V integrations—experience that translates directly to supporting executive home offices. What sets me apart is my ability to effectively navigate novel support challenges while managing expectations; this approach helped me earn Employee of the Year recognition in both 2022 and 2024.

Your emphasis on innovation and challenging consensus particularly resonates with me. At AlgoPulse Research, I've identified and developed automated processes that streamlined operations, saving over 100 hours of company time through custom PowerShell scripting and workflow optimization. My experience working collaboratively with teams across different time zones, combined with my refined communication skills and business acumen, positions me well to align priorities of executive requests across DRW's global operations. I'm a tenacious self-starter who constantly learns and promotes new technologies—my background spans cloud deployments, database management, and emerging fintech solutions.

The opportunity to support DRW's diversified trading operations while contributing to your culture of respect, curiosity, and open minds is genuinely compelling. I'm ready to own and improve support frameworks tailored to each executive while traveling as needed to ensure consistent service delivery.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing how my executive support experience can contribute to DRW's continued success.

Best regards,
Josh Hughes
