Dear Hiring Manager,

I came across the Software Engineer position at WealthCounsel, and honestly, the "Best Place to Work in the Cloud" award caught my eye - but what really made me want to apply was reading about your commitment to fostering genuine collaboration. I've worked in environments that just talk about culture, and I've worked in places that actually live it. The difference is everything.

At Information Technology Solutions, I've spent the last few years doing exactly what you're describing - building software that real people depend on. I developed a telehealth application that connected patients with doctors, and every line of code I wrote had someone's healthcare experience on the other end of it. That kind of responsibility makes you care deeply about writing clean, maintainable code and thinking through edge cases that might break someone's day.

I work primarily with JavaScript and TypeScript, building full-stack applications that need to scale and perform. I've architected database schemas, built RESTful APIs, and created frontend experiences using React that users actually enjoy. But honestly, what I'm most proud of isn't any single technology - it's how I approach problems. When something breaks, I don't just patch it. I dig into why it broke, fix the root cause, and document what I learned so the whole team benefits.

Your mention of code reviews and promoting best practices resonates with me. At AlgoPulse, I built a trading platform from scratch, and one of the first things I established was a culture of thorough code reviews. Not the kind where you just check boxes, but real conversations about why we're solving problems certain ways. I've learned as much from reviewing other people's code as I have from writing my own, and I genuinely believe that's where teams get stronger together.

The legal tech space is new territory for me, and I'll be honest - that's part of what excites me about this role. I learn quickly and I'm not afraid to ask questions when I don't understand something. When I needed to integrate complex APIs I'd never worked with before, I didn't pretend to know everything. I read documentation, experimented, broke things in development, and figured it out. That's how I've picked up every new technology in my career.

What really draws me to WealthCounsel is the sense that you're building something meaningful. Helping attorneys serve their clients better isn't just another SaaS product - it's enabling people to protect their families and plan their futures. That kind of mission makes coming to work feel less like a job and more like contributing to something that matters.

I'd love to talk more about how I could contribute to your team. Not just about the technical skills I bring, but about how I could fit into your culture and help continue building the kind of place people genuinely want to work.

Thanks for considering my application,

Josh Hughes
